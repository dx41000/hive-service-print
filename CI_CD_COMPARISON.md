./deploy-pipeline.sh -e prod -o your-org -t your-token

# Or deploy all environments
./setup-multi-env-pipeline.sh -o your-org -t your-token
```

**Resources Created:**
- CodePipeline (3 pipelines for 3 environments)
- CodeBuild projects (6 projects - build/deploy per env)
- ECR repositories
- S3 buckets for artifacts
- IAM roles and policies
- CloudWatch log groups

## üöÄ **GitHub Actions**

### **‚úÖ Advantages**

#### **Cost-Effective**
- 2,000 free minutes/month for private repos
- Unlimited for public repositories
- Only pay for AWS resources used
- **Total**: ~$0-10/month depending on usage

#### **Simplicity**
- Single YAML file configuration
- Version controlled with your code
- Easy to understand and modify
- Rich ecosystem of pre-built actions

#### **Flexibility**
- Highly customizable workflows
- Conditional deployments
- Matrix builds for multiple environments
- Easy integration with third-party services

#### **Developer Experience**
- Integrated with GitHub repository
- Rich UI for monitoring builds
- Easy debugging and troubleshooting

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
3. **Push to repository** - workflow runs automatically

**No additional AWS resources needed** - uses existing GitHub infrastructure.

## üîß **Detailed Feature Comparison**

### **Deployment Triggers**

#### **CodePipeline**
```yaml
# Automatic triggers via GitHub webhooks
# Separate pipelines for each environment
# Branch-based triggering
```

#### **GitHub Actions**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, staging]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

### **Environment Management**

#### **CodePipeline**
- **Separate pipelines per environment**
- Each pipeline has its own configuration
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent scaling and monitoring

#### **GitHub Actions**
- **Single workflow with environment detection**
- Dynamic environment selection based on branch
- Shared workflow logic
- GitHub Environments for protection rules

### **Secret Management**

#### **CodePipeline**
```bash
# AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/hive/github-token" --value "token" --type "SecureString"

# AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name "hive/github-token" --secret-string "token"
```

#### **GitHub Actions**
```bash
# GitHub Repository Secrets
# Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
# Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### **Monitoring and Logging**

#### **CodePipeline**
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Detailed build and deploy logs
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Pipeline success/failure rates
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Automated alerting
- **AWS Console**: Rich pipeline visualization

#### **GitHub Actions**
- **GitHub UI**: Workflow run details and logs
- **CloudWatch**: AWS resource logs (Lambda, etc.)
- **GitHub Notifications**: Email/Slack integration
- **Third-party monitoring**: DataDog, New Relic, etc.

- ‚úÖ You want faster setup and iteration

## üöÄ **Migration Path**

### **Start with GitHub Actions**
1. **Quick Setup**: Use the provided `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. **Test and Iterate**: Refine the workflow based on your needs
3. **Scale Up**: Add more sophisticated features as needed

### **Migrate to CodePipeline Later**
1. **When you need enterprise features**
2. **When cost becomes less of a concern**
3. **When you need more AWS-native integration**
4. **When you have complex approval workflows**

## üìã **Setup Instructions**

### **For GitHub Actions (Recommended for most users)**

1. **Copy the workflow file**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp .github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push
   ```

### **For CodePipeline (Enterprise/Complex deployments)**

1. **Deploy pipeline infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-pipeline.sh -e prod -o your-org -t your-github-token
   ```

2. **Monitor in AWS Console**:
   - Go to CodePipeline console
   - Watch pipeline executions

## ‚úÖ **Final Recommendation**

**For the Hive Service Print Lambda project, I recommend starting with GitHub Actions** because:

1. **Cost-effective**: ~$3/month vs ~$13/month
2. **Simpler setup**: Single YAML file vs multiple CloudFormation templates
3. **Faster iteration**: Easy to modify and test
4. **Good enough**: Handles all your current requirements
5. **Future-proof**: Can migrate to CodePipeline later if needed

The GitHub Actions workflow provided includes:
- ‚úÖ Multi-environment deployment
- ‚úÖ Docker image building and pushing
- ‚úÖ CloudFormation deployment
- ‚úÖ Integration testing
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Deployment summaries

You can always migrate to CodePipeline later when you need more enterprise features or have a larger budget for AWS-native solutions.
